          a Python persistence framework for graph databases


What is Bulbs?

Bulbs is a Python persistence framework for graph databases that supports 
Python 3 and Python 2.7.

It connects to several graph-database servers, including Neo4j Server and Rexster.

Neo4j Server is Neo4j's open-source REST server, and it is avalble as an
Heroku Add On (http://addons.heroku.com/neo4j).

Rexster is a graph-database REST server optimized for recommendations. 
It is part of the  TinkerPop stack and connects to any Blueprints-enabled 
graph database, including Neo4j, OrientDB, Dex, OpenRDF Sail, and TinkerGraph.

Bulbs supports pluggable backends, and more native bindings are in the works.

Is it ready?

A preview release is out now, and I welecome feedback on how to improve it.
The API will probably change somewhat until we hit 1.0.

What do I need?

* Neo4j Server (http://neo4j.org/), or 
* Rexster  (https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster)

And a few Python libraries, such as ujson and httplib2.

Where are the docs?

The 0.3.x docs are now online at http://bulbflow.com.
